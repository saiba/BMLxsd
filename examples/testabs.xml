<!--
Required timing:
nod1:start = 1
g1:start = 1
speech1:start = 1

Constraints:
c1 nod1:start, 1
c2 g1:start 1
c3 speech1:start 1
Note that this script should create 3 seperate constraints. 
The 3 behaviors have the same start time, but are not linked together.

Constraints tested in: test.bml.ParserTest
Timing tested in: test.bml.TestScheduler
