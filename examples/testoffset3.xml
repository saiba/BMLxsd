<!--
Required timing:
g1:start = 4
g2:end = 5
g2:start = 3
h1:start = g1:end, > 4
gaze1:start = 1
gaze1:end = g1:end+3 > 7

Constraints:
g2:start = g1:start-1 = g2:end-1 = 3 = gaze1:start+2
h1:start =g1:end = gaze1:end-3

Constraints tested in: test.bml.ParserTest
Timing tested in: test.bml.TestScheduler

Same as testoffset.xml, but with h1 as last behavior instead of 1st behavior
