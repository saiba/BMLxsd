<!--
Required timing:
g1:start = 4
g2:end = 5
g2:start = 3
h1:start = g1:end, > 4

Constraints:
h1:start = g1:end
g2:start = g1:start-1 = g2:end-2 = 4

Constraints tested in: test.bml.ParserTest
Timing tested in: test.bml.TestScheduler

Same as testoffset.xml, but with h1 as last behavior instead of 1st behavior
